       foo - frobnicate the bar library

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       ffoooo [[--bbaarr]] [[--cc _c_o_n_f_i_g_-_f_i_l_e ]] _f_i_l_e ......

       ffoooo  frobnicates the bar library by tweaking internal symbol tables. By
       default it parses all baz segments and rearranges them in reverse order
       by  time for the xxyyzzzzyy(1) linker to find them. The symdef entry is then
       compressed using the WBG (Whiz-Bang-Gizmo) algorithm.   All  files  are
       processed in the order specified.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -b     Do not write `busy' to stdout while processing.

       -c config-file
              Use   the   alternate   system   wide   _c_o_n_f_i_g_-_f_i_l_e  instead  of
              _/_e_t_c_/_f_o_o_._c_o_n_f.  This overrides any FFOOOOCCOONNFF environment variable.

       -a     In addition to the baz segments, also parse the blurfl headers.

       -r     Recursive mode. Operates as fast as lightning at the expense  of
              a megabyte of virtual memory.

FFIILLEESS
       _/_e_t_c_/_f_o_o_._c_o_n_f
              The  system  wide  configuration  file.  See  ffoooo(5) for further
              details.
       _~_/_._f_o_o_r_c
              Per user configuration file. See ffoooo(5) for further details.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       FOOCONF
              If non-null the full  pathname  for  an  alternate  system  wide
              _f_o_o_._c_o_n_f.  Overridden by the --cc option.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

       Bad magic number.
              The input file does not look like an archive file.
       Old style baz segments.
              ffoooo  can  only  handle  new  style  baz  segments.  COBOL object
              libraries are not supported in this version.

BBUUGGSS
       The command name should have been chosen more carefully to reflect  its
       purpose.
